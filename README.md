# Face-Recognition-System
Face recognition system using OpenCV and Dlib library with Raspberry Pi

This system was developed for the Microprocessor class. To recognize your face, you only need to introduce it once without needing dozens of your own pictures.

## Dependencies
- Dlib
- OpenCV
- Pandas
- Scipy

I'm still in the development process. sometimes giving some minor errors for the `input` function for versions 2 and 3 of python. it will also be added to run on raspberry pi and some errors will be fixed in the next releases.
